# Self Driving Vehicle Controller
This controller is made to autonomously follow a set of waypoints based on a given trajectory. Simulated and tested using CARLA. 

The blueprint for testing and development for the controller is provided by the Self-Driving Car Specialization from CourseEra/University of Toronto. The actual controller design is contained in `controller2d.py`.

### Controller Design
Longitudinal Controller: PID
Lateral Controller: Pure Pursuit
